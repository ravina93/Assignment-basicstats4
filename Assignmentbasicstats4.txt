Q2) Answer the three questions based on the box-plot below;

(Fig refer to word document)
A) What is the inter quartile range of this dataset? (Please approximate the numbers).In one
line,explain what this value implies.
B) What can we say about the skewness of this dataset?
C) If it was found that the data point with the value 25 is actually 2.5, how would the new box-plot
be affected?
Ans) A) Inter Quartile Range (IQR) : Q3 - Q1 = 12 - 5 = 7
The value of '7' (IQR) represents the Median of the provided box-plot.
B) The box-plot is right skewed (because the long part of the box-plot is present on right hand side).
Hence the box-plot is right skewed respectively.
C) The visualization of the plot would be sharper as compared to the old box plot.

Q3) Answer the following three questions based on the histogram below;

(Fig refer to word document)
A) Where would the mode of this dataset lie?
B) Comment on the skewness of the dataset.
Ans) A) The mode of this dataset lie in between [4 to 8] on X axis and above 20 on Y axis.
B) The histogram is right skewed and hence the outliers will also be present on right hand side.

Q4) AT&T was running commercials in 1990 aimed at luring back customers who had switched to one
of the other long distance phone service providers.One such commercial shows a businessmen trying
to reach Pheonix and mistakenly getting Fiji,where a half naked native on a beach responds 
incomprehensively in Polynesian.When asked about this advertisement,AT&T admitted that the portrayed
incident did not actually take place but added that his was an enactment of something that "could
happen".Suppose that one in 200 long-distance telephone calls are misdirected.What is the probability
that atleast one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number ? (Assume independence
of attempts).
Ans) Given : one in 200 long distance telephone calls are misdirected.
To find : Probability that atleast one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number.
Probability of call misdirecting P = 1/200
Probability of call not misdirecting = 1 - (1/200) = 199/200
Number of calls = 5
P(x) = n(Cx) (p^x) (q^n-x)
n = 5, p = 1/200, q = 199/200
Atleast one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number
1 - (none of the call reaches the wrong number)
1 - P(0)
1 - (5C0) (1/200)^0 (199/200)^5
1 - (199/200)^5
0.02475
Hence, the probability that atleast one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number is 0.02475

Q5) Returns on a certain business venture, to the nearest $1000, are known to follow the following
probability distribution;
x             P(x) 
-2000         0.1
-1000         0.1
0             0.2
1000          0.2
2000          0.3
3000          0.1
A) What is the most likely monetary outcomes of the business venture?
B) Is the venture likely to be successful? Explain
C) What is the long-term average earning of business ventures of this kind? Explain
D) What is the good measure of the risk involved in a venture of this kind? Compute this measure.
Ans) A) As the probability (0.3) is more for $2000 as compared to others,
Therefore most likely monetary outcome of the business venture = $2000
B) Long term average = [(-2000*0.1) + (-1000*0.1) + (0*0.2) + (1000*0.2) + (2000*0.3) + (3000*0.1)] = $800
As the lnog term average gives positive numbers the business venture is likely to be successful.
C)  Long term average = [(-2000*0.1) + (-1000*0.1) + (0*0.2) + (1000*0.2) + (2000*0.3) + (3000*0.1)] = $800
Means on an average return will be $800
